"""Batched T-maze training phase (Soltoggio-style T-maze/reversal paradigm).

Each individual in the batch runs its own independent sequence of maze runs, all
stepped in lockstep tick-by-tick so the whole population stays vectorized on GPU.
A run is 7 ticks (home, straight, straight, turn, straight, straight, mazeend) if
never crashed; a wrong output at any tick ends the run immediately (crash penalty,
reset to start). The CTRNN state and weights W are NEVER reset between runs or
maze resets -- only the maze/task bookkeeping (position, reward arm, sensory cue)
resets. This is what makes the plasticity itself the thing being evolved.

context_cues_on / sensory_cues_on: when False, the corresponding input neurons are
clipped to zero activity every tick instead of carrying their normal cue value. The
neurons stay in the network (same neuron count in every condition) -- they are just
denied any signal, so evolution cannot repurpose them as free processing units.

Reward schedule (see constants.py "REWARD SCHEDULE" section for the full spec):
  - Crashing (choosing straight when a turn is required, or vice versa) always
    costs CRASH_PENALTY and ends the run immediately, no matter which tick it
    happens on.
  - Choosing a valid direction at the turn tick pays out immediately (does NOT
    end the run) -- TURN_REWARD_BIG if that arm matches this run's big-reward
    arm, else TURN_REWARD_SMALL. The run then continues down that corridor.
  - Reaching mazeend without crashing pays out again, using the same
    big/small-arm logic, ending the run.
  - Any turn payout already earned is kept even if the run later crashes, so a
    fully successful run pays out twice (up to BIG_REWARD + BIG_REWARD = 2.0),
    a run that crashes after turning keeps the turn payout minus CRASH_PENALTY,
    and a run that crashes before ever turning only pays CRASH_PENALTY.
